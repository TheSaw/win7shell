# Buy me a beer, if you like this plug-in #

<br />

| Hello, my name is Atti, and I am the primary developer of this plug-in. <br><b>Please sacrifice 2 minutes of your precious time</b>, as I've sacrificed <br>hundreds of sleepless hours to create this for you, since I started it <br>more than two years ago, <b>and read this page :)</b>. Here is a picture of <br>me basking in sunlight, so you have an idea who is talking to you. <table><thead><th> <img src='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3568892/me.jpg' /> </th></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> <img src='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3568892/Pictures/mountain_h.jpg' /> </td><td> This is also me on this year's mountain trip. I'm a bit shy.<br> You have nothing (except pennies) to lose, so make me <br>(and you) happy by trading some of these pennies for <b>good</b><br>feelings<b>; after all, that's what they're for, right? Right.</b><br>Because we both deserve it! Every little counts a lot :). </td></tr></tbody></table>

<br />

<h2>Why you should buy me a beer :-)</h2>

<ul><li>Because beer is good, and a "temporary solution" to everything<br>
</li><li>To thank me for working hard for free to create this plug-in<br>
</li><li>To support open-source software development (free = good)<br>
</li><li>To assist with continuing development<br>
</li><li>You're a good person who values the effort of other people<br>
</li><li>Because I will write your name on a shiny thank you list (if you want)<br>
</li><li>Because I will give you a hug of appreciation</li></ul>

<h2>Why you should not buy me a beer :-(</h2>

<ul><li>Because you don't have money (I understand, thanks for reading)<br>
</li><li>Because you're lazy to spend 5 minutes on this<br>
</li><li>Because you're cheap<br>
</li><li>You don't like the plug-in :(<br>
</li><li>You don't appreciate free work</li></ul>

<br />

All jokes aside, I really do ask only for something small, something that isn't a big deal for you. Unfortunately many of you don't live in my area, and you can't buy me an actual beer, so I've set up a (completely secure) PayPal account where you can "donate a beer" to show your support. I will be extremely grateful.<br>
