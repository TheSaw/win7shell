# System Requirements #

### Operating System ###

First of all, don't even try to use this plug-in, if you don't have <b>Windows 7</b> (Or maybe Windows 2010 Server). It was tested on the final versions, the beta and RC releases are not supported.

### Winamp ###

It is highly recommended to use the latest version of Winamp (5.58 for now).
The minimum version of Winamp is 5.5. Older versions are not supported, use at your own risk / don't complain if something doesn't work.

### Hardware ###

The plug-in itself doesn't require extra resources, but some of the features require Aero Peek enabled, which on it's turn requires a decent GPU.

# Installation #

The NSIS installer takes care of everything, just run it. It will close Winamp, copy the plug-in to the detected Winamp folder, replaces the old one if necessary, and restarts Winamp. You can delete the installer after it's finished.

# Configuration #

You can access the plug-in configuration via the <b>Winamp Preferences -> Plug-ins -> General Purpose -> Windows 7 Taskbar Integration</b>
